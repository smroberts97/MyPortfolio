                    Hi! I love technology! Always and forever. I am new at learning web development. I have always worked with technology but I want to go deeper with a more formal education in coding. I am excited to be learning a new skill that will logically dovetail with my background. I am a process improvement expert, trained in the Six Sigma methodology by GE Healthcare as a Master Black Belt. I started my professional career in healthcare, at a large hospital system where I was part of the Process Improvement and Quality team which was tasked with rolling out the Six Sigma methodology throughout the hospital system.
                    <br><br>
                    My main projects were improving Emergency Department wait time and Patient Throughput in the healthcare system. I also worked in Human Resources to improve their application process, and in the CardioVascular Operating Room to improve teamwork and process flow in the OR. Our largest project was the automation of the hospital's medical records to convert them to electronic records, or EMR. I was on the team that explored the outsourcing companies such as Siemens and McKesson. Our department's job was to optimize the existing process to be technology ready. Currently I work for my own company, and I focus on process improvement, typically in small businesses. I have found that in the process improvement industry, many of the solutions are electronic and web based software. In order to be able to offer the companies I work for a wider skill set, I am excited to dive deeper into the understanding and inner workings of the web and software development. 
                    <br><br>
                    I have an undergraduate degree from the University of Kentucky in Industrial Psychology and a Master's Degree in Industrial Relations from Marshall University. I have a minor degree in English and I love to write. I am an online research guru and grammar nerd. I also love databases, data, analytics, and making decisions based on data-driven metrics. A quote I commonly use is "In God we trust; everyone else bring data."
                    <br><br> 
                    I am a mom of two, and I live in Vero Beach Florida with my husband, kids and pets. I enjoy photography, running, swimming, triathlon, stand-up paddleboarding, fishing, and yoga. My favorite sport is watching my kids' swim meets, baseball games and dance competitions. Our family makes frequent trips to Disney, but we also like to camp and travel to adventurous outdoor locations. Our recent family adventures include rafting down the Colorado River into the Grand Canyon, and hiking in the backcountry of Yellowstone National Park.
